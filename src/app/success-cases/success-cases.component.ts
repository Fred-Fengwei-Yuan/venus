      CSS and Node.js but also soft skills like communication skills, 
      time management skills, teamwork and problem-solving skills. Those soft skills are which you can’t get from the university. 
      It helps me a lot to improve both my tech skills and soft skills til finally, I get a job from Macau as an IT developer. 
      Highly recommend someone who graduated from university but doesn’t have many working experiences. `
