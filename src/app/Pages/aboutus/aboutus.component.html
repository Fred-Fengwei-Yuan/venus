                Our History
                </b>
                <br><br>
                Gradspace is a program set up to train and prepare tertiary students with relevant degrees to enter the IT profession. 
                In 2018, we took on 20 interns to help build a web application project <a href="www.learnspace.co.nz">www.learnspace.co.nz</a>. 
                Out of those who stuck around and put in some hard work, 100% of them successfully found jobs and learnt practical skills and had an opportunity to demonstrate competencies required by the IT workforce. 
                With the feedback received, we decided to formally arrange this program, to help more graduates out there needing career advice and mentoring by industry professionals, and a place where they can apply their academic learning, build up their portfolio, have something solid on their CV to reach their dream jobs, without having to go through too many trail and error processes.
