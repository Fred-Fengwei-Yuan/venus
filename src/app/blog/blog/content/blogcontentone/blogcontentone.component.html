                        <h1 class="s2" style="color:black;">Want to study at a university in the US, but not sure how to get there? For starters, you will have to register for the SAT.</h1>
                        <br>
                        <h1 class="s2" style="color:black;">The SAT is one of two standardised tests you can sit in order to apply to US universities. The alternative exam is the ACT, but is typically lesser known.</h1>

                        <h1 class="s2" style="color:black;">The SAT is an entrance exam used by most colleges and universities in the US to make admissions decisions. The purpose of the SAT is to measure a student’s readiness for college, and provide colleges with one common data point that can be used to compare all applicants.</h1>

                        <h1 class="s2" style="color:black;">The SAT exam consists of four sections: Reading, Writing and Language, Math with calculator, and Math no calculator. There’s also an optional essay section. All of the sections (minus the essay) are multiple choice and each section features at least one graph or table.</h1>

                        <h1 class="s2" style="color:black;">Most US universities suggest taking the exam in Year 11. This gives you plenty of time to receive your score before beginning your application.</h1>

                        <h1 class="s2" style="color:black;">The easiest way to apply for the SAT is to register online via the College Board website. You will need to create a free profile before registering.</h1>
